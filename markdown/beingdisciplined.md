## Preface
I want to preface this with a contradictory-sounding statement: **Discipline is not something you have!**  
It is a trait you bear from time to time. Discipline will come and go: you will have periods where you feel undisciplined, or very disciplined. It is always in you to do what you must, it's only a matter of whether you're able to see it right now or not.

## What even is discipline?!
Discipline can be a tricky concept to define. It is a socially loaded topic, and people will give varying descriptions of what discipline is. Some people will say "pushing yourself to do something, even though you don't want to". Others might say its "working hard", "being hard on yourself" or "getting shit done!". These are all aspects of discipline, but don't give a holistic perspective.  

In my personal experience, discipline has always been about staying with a task despite its struggles, but also learning to enjoy the positive aspects of it, seeing the struggle as a struggle - potential to grow as a person.  
However, there are different types of struggles, lets dive deeper.

## The different types of struggle
So, discipline is cultivated by struggle, resisting the urge to give up. Discipline can perhaps be seen as  
"*the mindset that appears in you, as a result of successfully and healthily resisting the urge to give up on a task you should be doing.*"  
But how do you resist your urges in a healthy way? It is also a mindset in of itself.  
The proper mindset behind the struggle - struggling with purpose and intent - gives you the mindset of discipline. Let's look at the good and the bad struggles.

### Firstly, there is the bad struggle
The struggle that generates suffering. You hate yourself and the task youre doing - you are suffering. This suffering arises from thoughts - as a result of your mental image of youself, how you view yourself in your situation.  
You might feel small, inadequate or pathetic. These are thoughts that appear out of comparison to others, out of contrasts, and thus, self-criticism ensues.  
> Look at me, look how *contrasting* I am compared to everyone else - I suck at this, and everyone else is so good. I have been trying this for ages, and I still manage to screw it up!


This can sometimes be a toxic spiral, where your thoughts perpetuate your self-image, which perpetuate your suffering and **hate**.  

**Hate** is the recognition of a situation bound with a negative context. It needs this context to exist. A situation never generates hate on itself. It is the mindset around the situation that creates the hate, thus creating the bad struggle - associating a task with hateful thoughts about oneself.  
Hate is never inherited, it is conditioned - part of "the conditioned mind", if you will.  

This bears truth, at least in the context of tasks: you cannot hate a task you havent done. You can think you will hate it, but that's, again, your conditioning speaking. You are also here, comparing and gaugeing the boredom/hateability of a task based on your previous experiences.

Confusion, or not knowing where to start, is also another big topic. This is where the mind is clouded, either by the volume of options present, or the abstractness of the task. Doing something without knowledge requires research. Starting by gathering context on the topic or task ahead will give you a better understanding of what needs to be done.

#### In summary
The bad struggle is the stuggle which clouds your mind, makes you suffer.

### Secondly, there is good struggle
The good struggle is the struggle that simply puts your conditioning aside, focusing on the practicalities around what needs to be done, instead of ruminating in how much of a drag this task will be. Digging youself into the nitty gritty of it, feeling disgusted
The recognition that struggle builds character, builds identity. Even though . Discipline is not something you have
