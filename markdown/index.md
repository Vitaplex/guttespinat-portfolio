### Friluft - Lushious Forest
**Release date:** *To be determined..*  
**Development time:** *Feb. 2025 - `DateTime.Now.ToString("MMM. YYYY")`*  
### [**To be released... ↗**]() 
gm_friluft is the newest sandbox map I have been working on for Garry's Mod, and is inspired by Norwegian forests and nature.  
"Friluft" is a Norwegian word, meaning "open air" or "outdoors" and captures the essence of being outside in nature. It’s most commonly seen in the term friluftsliv, which means "outdoor life" or "living close to nature."

### Funkis - Mid Century Modern house
**Release date:** *Dec. 2024*  
**Development time:** *Aug. 2024 - Dec. 2024*  
### [**View on the Steam workshop ↗**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3380651069) 

Funkis (gm_funkis) is a sandbox map for Garry's Mod. I wanted to create a contemporary Mid Century Modern (MCM) - style home. The design and layout is original, but draws alot of inspiration from Norwegian "funkis"-architecture from the '60-'70s.
As an additional feature, I added an underground secret laboratory with a secret elevator entrance, to make the map more playful. The map was very well received and a night time version was also released.  
The map features lots of custom assets, as I wanted to challenge myself to get good at Blender. I made many custom assets which can be shown further down on this page.

### Granli - 70s style home
**Release date:** *Jul. 2024*  
**Development time:** Jun. 2024 - Jul. 2024  
### [**View on the Steam workshop ↗**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3295125118) 

I wanted to create a detailed, accurate building of a Norwegian style late 70s/early 80s home, in a style typical for houses financed by The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken). The map started as a simple project but developed into a more feature-complete map.  
I added some lore and backstory to give it more character. A night version was also released.

### Polaria Systems - Underground Dungeon
**Release date:** *Jun. 2024*  
**Development time:** Mar. 2023 - Jun. 2024  
### [**View on NexusMods ↗**](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84454) 

A enormous underground facility dungeon for Fallout 4, structured as a simple loot-and-shoot adventure. The map features numerous areas to explore, secrets to find, mini-bosses, collectibles and of course lots of enemies to defeat.  

The dungeon is near DLC-sized and provide hours of exploration. A normal playthrough can take from 2 to 5 hours or more to complete. Spread throughout are also two unlockable checkpoints, so the player can traverse Polaria Systems at their own pace, and take breaks to head back to the Commonwealth.  
Polaria Systems also does not use any custom content apart from scripts - which makes the mod available for release on both PC, Xbox and Playstation!

The mod has been extremely well received and has been included in user-created essential modpacks for the game.

### Companion areas
An additional feature of the dungeon is "companion-specific" areas. These areas are areas with additional loot for the player, but requires that they bring a dog companion or any companion which can fit through small gaps, in order to press a button and unlock a door for the player to collect the loot. This was inspired from Lego-games, where certain characters are needed to unlock secrets or areas.  
This was a stupidly simple mechanic, but many people enjoyed it alot.

### Block Watne Type 60 - Simple House
**Release date:** *May. 2024*  
**Development time:** May. 2024  
### [**View on the Steam workshop ↗**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3250625300) 

gm_type60 was my first attempt at a proper house, and i wanted to go off of schematics. I found a housing catalog for The Norwegian State Housing Bank from 1976 online, and went off of the schematics to recreate the house from the illustrations.

### High Tech City - Retrofuturistic City
**Release date:** *Aug. 2022*  
**Development time:** 2018/Oct.2021 - Aug.2022  
### [**View on the Steam workshop ↗**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2856036399) 
A retrofuturistic large city map. This was my first large map project, which really challenged me on how to create and optimize a large open map in the Source engine - which is designed for more narrow corridor-like maps. Getting the map optimized and running well-enough was a big challenge that took up months of development.

### Layout
The layout of the city was not pre-planned, and I made up the layout as I went along, and made changes underway to account for gameplay and optimization.
