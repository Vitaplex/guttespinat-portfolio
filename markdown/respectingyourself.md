## Preface
Even when you feel you have gained self-respect - you have a fair assumption of your position in this world - you will still encounter moments where the self-respect lessens, you feel vulnerable, exposed and even scared.  
This is not "losing it", recessing or "falling off", this being human. Part of respecting yourself is realizing your humanity, and even through self-respect and a honed mindset, you will still have moments where you feel weak.

## Understanding self-respect
To better understand what respecting yourself means, let's dive into what it is not.  

## Not Respecting Yourself - An Example
### Scenario
You are working on a writing project. So far, everything seems to be going well. You are doing good progress and eventually, you finish it within the scheduled time. You deliver the assignment. However, upon gracing the assignment papers once more, you see that what you have written is completely off from what the assignment asked for. The assignment was about **"The nutritional benefit of fruits"**. However, what you wrote about **"The short-term benefits of a carnivore diet"**.  


> #### **The respectful**
> If you have cultivated self-respect, you could laugh this off as a human error; mistakes happen, and the fact that you were able to produce something, even if its about the wrong topic, is a great achievement in of itself. You're not defined by your mistakes. 

> #### **The non-respectful**
> The respect-less self will hate you for not seeing it so clearly, thinking **"how is it possible I could have messed up this bad?!"**. You doubt yourself and you ability to read, comprehend or complete a task. Thoughts of your peers might come to mind - and how great - and accurate - their assignments must be.  
> You are in the Dunning-Kruegerian Valley of Despair, and you dont know how to crawl your way out.

## What does this mean?
And this is the crux of self-respect: it is something cultivated from within, and not defined by external factors, like how good you are at something, or how much you do. If anything, self-respect is being good at knowing you are human. It's all about accepting your humanity, that you will make mistakes, and you will have ups and downs.

This example shows how the non-respectful self relies on external circumstances, along with expectations, and comparisons, to dictate their feelings. Both experience defeat; their written work is useless, but it's their self-respect, how they know themself, and orient themself around the negativity, that dictates if they stay self-critical and suffer, or can live with their situation.
