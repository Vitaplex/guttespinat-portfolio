# The Illusory Self

## Preface
I am not addressing the illusory self as some abstract concept of the human psyche; I am directly referencing you and your current subjective experience. I am speaking directly to **you**!  

Keep this in mind as we move on.

## Where Did You Begin - And Where Do You End?
What defines you?  
Who are you?  
What are you?  
Right now; if you were asked to point towards you, you might put your finger on your chest, or even your head. "I am the brain" you might say.

And you would not be wrong - there is an entity here which has a subjective experience, and is able to point towards itself as the center in which that subjective experience takes place.

### Going deeper
However, if you were the one doing the pointing, and also the one being pointed at - where, then, do you begin, and where do you end?  
You assume thereâ€™s a clear distinction between "the pointer" (the subject) and "the pointee" (the object).  
But both arise within the same field of awareness - your experience.  
The "pointer" (the body, the thought, the intention) and the "pointee" (the self you identify with) both appear as abstractions of a bigger whole.

It is natural to think who you are now began at birth, and ends with death, however the person you were at birth, or a year ago, or five years ago, is not the same as who you are now - right now.  
The 1-year-old you wouldn't even be able to read this text, let alone make any sense of it. How can that possibly be the same person as the one reading this now?

The human body, the thoughts, the experiences, the sense of self, the you - nothing of this is permanent. Who you are, is never anything concrete. The self that thinks itself separate, reacts to its environment with the conditioned mind - with feelings; doubt, anger, resentment, regret, pity, happiness, joy, apathy, fear. This mind will, and cannot, last.  

A humans sense of self is a fluid, ever-changing experience:  
One day you might have certain opinions, reactions and views. Another day you will have completely different mindset, and thus reaction, to your environment. It is a sense of self that persists, among many things, through identity, routines, habits, safety and belonging.

### Example - The Ship of Theseus
This bears a striking resemblande to the philosophical thought experiment of the **Ship of Theseus**.  
It poses the question: If all the components of something is gradually replaced over time, will it still be the same thing?  

This thought experiment is out-of-touch with the nature of reality in the sense that the **Ship of Theseus** - the name of the ship, is not the ship! It is a label given to something that humans perceive with their human senses as a persisting entity in the physical realm. **The Ship of Theseus never exists**, there is something that able-minded humans perceive as a ship, and the name is something applied to top of the ship-like structure. **It has an identity!**

_When is the ship not the same ship anymore? Was it ever anything to begin with?_


### The Human Perspective
Humans are similar in this regard, they are physical, persisting entities, also with an ever-changing experience.  
The main contender for giving a sense of persistence is the human mind. With its ability to retain memories, experiences and beliefs. These constructs are added **on top** of what you already are. This build and strengthen ones **identity**, routines, habits, safety and belonging.  
_I am this person with these experiences, world views, beliefs, ways of doing things!_  

### Human evolution
This is by no means a bad thing in of itself - being a human with a sense of self is, naturally, mandatory for functioning as a human being. If you had no values, desires, no drive or ambition, no notion of purpose; not having a sense of self would leave you as a apathetic lump of biomass.  
In fact, humans' sense of self has been crucial to the survival of humanity as a species. Being curious, precautious, beings grouping together to form tribes, forming social relationships. These things were one of the main factors making humans evolve and develop into the advanced species we are now!

**However** - the behavior that perpetuated human evolution and survival is also the one responsible for our fear of the unknown, the dark, the perceived dangers and uncertainty. These are all mechanisms evolutionary designed to help humans survive.  
* New people are scary because they arent a part of your tribe (close group of friends).  
* New situations are scary because they expose you to something unknown and uncertain.  

Humans have a drive towards knowing the **what**s, **where**s, **when**s and **why**s. If one or more is missing, **anxiety** sets in as a protective mechanism - making you alert and ready to flee at a moments notice!

Anxiety as a protective mechanism was good for survival 50 000 years ago - but in the modern age of technology, with their comparisons, ideals, goals and images, these mechanisms have a tendency to do more harm than good. 

Hopefully, it is now established that there is something labeled as a human being here, with a subjective experience. However, that subjective experience is fleeting and everchanging. It is never something stable, you cannot point to your sense of self and think; "this is who I am". If you could, why then, can you wake up the next morning and feel completely out of touch with that reality. What happened to the "I"?

## The capitalistic mind

Many people are concerned with "making it", being enough, getting to a state where you deem yourself a success, and your life sufficient. This is a mindset portrayed alot in social media, by influencers and public figures, as a way to  This is a fallacy of the material mind, as it thinks that to be fulfilled, you 

## What Is Beyond The You

The big change happens when you realize You are none of these things - You are not a person having a subjective experience; You are an expression of the universe itself!  

The you that has a subjective experience is a product of the You which really **is** the universe itself. The human which you are is the universe coalescing through a unfathomable series of causalities; products of circumstance, evolution, reproduction,  which allows the subjective you to be here, now, as an inseparable expression of the whole - of the universe.
