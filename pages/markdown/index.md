## Work Stuff
I work as a backend developer/devops engineer at [Norsk helsenett ↗](https://www.nhn.no/), specializing in the development and operation of national e-health services, mainly [Pasientens journaldokumenter ↗](https://www.nhn.no/tjenester/pasientens-journaldokumenter).  

### Work projects
[**🌐 XcaDocumentSource - XCA Responding Gateway and Integrated Registry and Repository ↗**](https://github.com/timmo-nhn/XcaDocumentSource)  
This is a web-service solution developed in [ASP.NET Core ↗](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet), facilitating the storing and retreiving of patient-healthcare-related information in a content-agnostic format.  
The solution implements this utilizing standards like [OASIS ebXML RegRep ↗](https://docs.oasis-open.org/regrep/regrep-core/v4.0/os/regrep-core-rim-v4.0-os.pdf), **IHE** [XDS ↗](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-10.html) and [XCA ↗](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-18.html)  
This allows **XcaDocumentSource** to act as a **document source** for hospitals and healthcare businesses who want to share their patients healthcare records, contributing to better communication and patient care.
