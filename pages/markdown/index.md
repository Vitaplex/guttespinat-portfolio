## Work Stuff
I work as a backend developer/devops engineer at [Norsk helsenett ‚Üó](https://www.nhn.no/), specializing in the development and operation of national e-health services, mainly [Pasientens journaldokumenter ‚Üó](https://www.nhn.no/tjenester/pasientens-journaldokumenter).  

### Work projects
[**üåê XcaDocumentSource - XCA Responding Gateway and Integrated Registry and Repository ‚Üó**](https://github.com/timmo-nhn/XcaDocumentSource)  
This is a web-service solution developed in [ASP.NET Core ‚Üó](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet), facilitating the storing and retreiving of patient-healthcare-related information in a content-agnostic format.  
The solution implements this utilizing standards like [OASIS ebXML RegRep ‚Üó](https://docs.oasis-open.org/regrep/regrep-core/v4.0/os/regrep-core-rim-v4.0-os.pdf), **IHE** [XDS ‚Üó](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-10.html) and [XCA ‚Üó](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-18.html) and [XACML 2.0 ‚Üó](https://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/2.0/access_control-xacml-2.0-core-spec-os.pdf) for access control.   
This allows **XcaDocumentSource** to act as a **document source** for hospitals and healthcare businesses who want to share their patients healthcare records, contributing to better communication and patient care.
