To effectively control who gets access to resources, **PJD.XcaDocumentSource** implements the P*P pattern for access control and authorization (PEP, PDP, PR), leveraging standards like **XACML Version 2.0** - part of the broader **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** domain.  

See [Xacml 2.0 Core Spec (PDF) - docs.oasis-open.org â†—](https://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/2.0/access_control-xacml-2.0-core-spec-os.pdf) for more info.

### Explanation
&emsp;1.&nbsp;*A request is sent to one of **PJD.XcaDocumentSource's** endpoints which uses **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)*** 

&emsp;2.&nbsp;*The **PEP** Extracts a Xacml V2.0 request from the requests authorization details (ie. SAML-token in a SOAP-envelope or JWT in HTTP headers)*

&emsp;3.&nbsp;*The **PEP** sends the request to the **Policy Decision Point (PDP)***

&emsp;4.&nbsp;*The **PDP** queries - or has cached - The **Policy Repository (PR)***

&emsp;5.&nbsp;*The **PDP** has evaluated the request against the policies in the Repository and sends the decision result back to the Policy Enforcement Point*

&emsp;6.&nbsp;*The **PEP** receives the decision response.*

&emsp;6.1.&nbsp;*The **PEP** sends the request on to the API-endpoint*  

&emsp;6.2.&nbsp;*The **PEP** denies the request*

## Requests and Policies
In the user authorization domain, there are three parts; the Requests, the Policies and the Evaluation Engine.
The Evaluation Engine contains the Policies, and is able to validate an incoming Request based on this.

subgraph "Evaluation Engine"
  direction TB
  pol[(&emsp;Policies&emsp;)]
  eval[Evaluation]
end

req[XACML Request]
req<--Evaluation<br>Request/Response-->eval
```

## Policy Enforcement Point
**The Policy Enforcement Point** (PEP) sits in front of an API-endpoint (such as the SOAP-endpoints) and intercepts (enforces a policy upon) the request by parsing the authentication details from the request and sending it to the Policy Decision Point (PDP), to authorize the request.
