To be sparse in speech is to be spontaneous.  
Thus wind squalls do not outlast the morning and teeming rain does not outlast the day.  
Who causes these? Heaven and earth.  
Even heaven and earth cannot long persist thus, how much less can man.  
Those who follow the Dao are alike in Dao with others who follow the Dao, are alike in virtue with others who have virtue, are alike is loss with others who have loss.  
Alike in Dao with others who follow the Dao - he delights indeed in grasping the Dao; alike in virtue with others who have virtue - he delights indeed in having virtue; alike in loss others who have loss - he delights indeed in having loss.
Where faithfulness is insufficient there is unfaithfulness.

The highest virtue (de) is without virtue, hence it has virtue. The lowest virtue never deviates from virtue, hence it lacks virtue.  
The highest virtue does not act (wuwei) and has no reason to act; the lowest virtue acts and has reason to act.  
The highest ren acts without any reason to act.  
The highest right (yi) acts and has reason to act.  
The highest li acts, and if no persons respond, rolls up its sleeves and twists their arms.  
Hence, only after the Dao is lost is there virtue; only after virtue is lost is there ren; only after ren is lost is there right; only after right is lost is there li.  
Li is the thinning of loyalty and faithfulness, when chaos first raises its head.  
Foreknowledge is the blossom of the Dao, when ignorance first begins. Therefore, the great man dwells in the thick, not in the thin; abides in the fruit, not in the blossom.  
Thus he discards the one and grasps the other.
